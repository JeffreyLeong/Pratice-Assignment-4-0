Description
Let's write an oracle program to answer any question mankind has! The program will answer either YES, NO, or MAYBE. It will also allow the user to repeat asking for answers.

Version 1 
Straight random answer.
Use one function to randomly pick and print out the answer.
Users can repeat asking for guidance.

Version 2 
Change your function so that at the end, the oracle will print also the last answer (Your last answer was xxx).
Expect to change the one function you already have in v1.

Version 2 Demo
